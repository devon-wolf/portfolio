My portfolio/personal site

## Stack
I wanted to keep things simple to better reflect my own design and tooling preferences - while I truly enjoy working in React, for example, it seemed absurd to use so many extra tools on this project when plain-old vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS would do the job with no protest.

So that's what you'll see. Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, doing their thing. As the project progresses I expect it will be served up from a minimal Node JS backend using Express for ease of sharing files such as my resume.

## Design Resources

The icons used throughout come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The 'Ostrich Sans' font comes from [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ostrich-sans).

The 'Roboto Condensed' font comes from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed#about).

The color scheme was designed using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

As for the text content throughout? It's my portfolio, I'm not really precious about any groundbreaking prose you might find here, but I ask that you not re-use it without my permission if for some reason you feel that urge.
